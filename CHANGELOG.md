# Change Log for Student Management Application

## Version 4.0.0 (Build Date: 21/02/2025)

### Summary

This version introduces significant improvements to the codebase, focusing on modularity, maintainability, and adherence to software design principles such as **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**.

---

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Logging Initialization**

- **What Changed**: Extracted logging setup into a reusable function `initialize_logging`.
- **Why**:
  - Adheres to SRP by separating logging configuration from the main application logic.
  - Simplifies future updates to logging behavior.

---

#### 2. **Centralized Database Connection Handling**

- **What Changed**: Introduced the `with_db_connection` decorator to manage database connections for functions like `get_config` and `can_delete_student`.
- **Why**:
  - Reduces repetitive code for opening and closing database connections.
  - Ensures proper resource management, avoiding potential connection leaks.
  - Adheres to the DRY principle.

---

#### 3. **TreeView Creation Refactor**

- **What Changed**: Extracted repetitive `TreeView` setup code into a reusable function `create_treeview`.
- **Why**:
  - Simplifies the code by avoiding duplication of `TreeView` setup logic.
  - Makes the code more maintainable and adheres to the DRY principle.

---

#### 4. **Centralized Validation Logic**

- **What Changed**: Consolidated student data validation into a single reusable function `validate_student_data`.
- **Why**:
  - Avoids duplicating validation logic across methods like `add_student` and `update_student`.
  - Ensures consistency in validation and adheres to the DRY principle.

---

#### 5. **Improved Config Management**

- **What Changed**: Refactored `get_config` to use the `with_db_connection` decorator for better connection handling.
- **Why**:
  - Simplifies database interaction.
  - Ensures proper resource management.

---

#### 6. **Dynamic Combobox Updates**

- **What Changed**: Added `_update_comboboxes` to dynamically update combobox values in forms when options are added or deleted.
- **Why**:
  - Ensures that UI elements reflect the latest data without requiring a full application restart.

---

#### 7. **Improved Import/Export Logic**

- **What Changed**: Enhanced error handling and validation during data import/export operations.
- **Why**:
  - Ensures robustness by validating data before importing.
  - Provides meaningful error messages for invalid files.

---

#### 8. **Centralized Logging for Status Changes**

- **What Changed**: Added `log_status_change` to log status transitions for students.
- **Why**:
  - Centralizes logging logic for status changes.
  - Makes it easier to extend (e.g., adding notifications) in the future.

---

#### 9. **Reusable Scrollable Frame for Config Management**

- **What Changed**: Added a scrollable frame for managing configuration settings.
- **Why**:
  - Improves usability by allowing users to manage a large number of configuration options without UI clutter.

---

### Benefits of Changes

1. **Modularity**: Each function now has a single, well-defined responsibility.
2. **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication makes the codebase easier to update and debug.
3. **Scalability**: Reusable components like `create_treeview` and `validate_student_data` make it easier to extend the application.
4. **Robustness**: Centralized error handling and validation improve the reliability of the application.
