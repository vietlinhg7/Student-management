## Source Code Structure

```
ex1.py       # Main application file containing GUI and database logic
students.db  # SQLite database file (auto-generated when running the program)
```

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later). The following Python modules are required:

- `sqlite3`
- `tkinter`
- `re`
- `datetime`

Tkinter is included with standard Python installations, so no additional installation is needed.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the source code directory.

## How to Run

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python ex1.py
```

This will launch the Student Management System GUI.

## Database Information

The program uses an SQLite database (`students.db`) to store student records. The database and table are created automatically when the application is first run.
